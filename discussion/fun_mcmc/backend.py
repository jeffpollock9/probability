In this backend you specify the transport map inverse and log determinant of the
jacobian manually. Each transform must have a field called `inverse` which
contains the inverse transformation and the `extra` return is a 2-tuple, where
the first element is arbitrary and the the last element is the log determinant
of the jacobian of the transformation.

Here's an example of a complete specification of an invertible function that
works with this backend:

```python
def scale_by_two(x):
  # Return x unchanged for illustrative purposes.
  return 2 * x, (x, np.log(2))

def scale_by_half(x):
  return x / 2, (x, -np.log(2))

scale_by_half.inverse = scale_by_two

y, y_extra, y_ldj = value_and_ldj(scale_by_2, 3.)
assert y == 6
assert y_extra == 3

  A backend is a module with three submodules:

  - `tfp` providing a subset of TensorFlow Probability API
  - `util` providing certain utilities

  The above are deliberately vague, and are unstable in terms of API. You can,
  however, experiment with new backends by looking at the existing
  implementations for inspiration.

  If multiple backends are provided, then later backends override the earlier
  ones.

  """Multi-backend test decorator.

  The end goal of this decorator is that the decorated test case is removed, and
  replaced with a set of new test cases that have been rewritten to use one or
  more backends. E.g., a test case named `Test` will by default be rewritten to
  `Test_tf` and `Test_jax` which use the TensorFlow and JAX backends,
  respectively.

  The decorator works by using the dynamic rewrite system to rewrite imports of
  the module the test is defined in, and inserting the approriately renamed test
  cases into the `globals()` dictionary of the original module. A side-effect of
  this is that the global code inside the module is run `1 + len(backends)`
  times, so avoid doing anything expensive there. This does mean that the
  original module needs to be in a runnable state, i.e., when it uses symbols
  from `backend`, those must be actually present in the literal `backend`
  module.

  A subtle point about what this decorator does in the rewritten modules: the
  rewrite system replaces the backend modules from which this decorator is
  imported. The versions of this decorator in the backend-specific backend
  modules act as a passthrough to avoid infinite rewriting loops.

  Args:
    globals_dict: Python dictionary of strings to symbols. Set this to the value
      of `globals()`.
    relative_module_name: Python string. The module name of the module where the
      decorated test resides relative to `fun_mcmc`. You must not use `__name__`
      for this as that is set to the defective value of `"__main__"` when the
      tests are run via absl's test runner, which is sufficiently abnormal that
      the rewrite system does not work on it.
    backends: Python iterable of strings. Which backends to test with.
    test_case: The actual test case to decorate.

  Returns:
    None, to delete the original test case.
